# About this repository
## My personal installation scripts for Arch Linux

While experimenting with Arch Linux, I have decided to write a simple bash script to keep my life much easier.

## KICKS
Keep It a Complete Killjoy Script.

## Themes
#### GRUB
I am currently using a [modified Vimix](https://github.com/vinceliuice/grub2-themes/tree/master/grub-theme-vimix/Vimix/icons) theme for 
[GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Theme).
I should fork the mentioned theme to add custom ICONs for shutdown, reboot and firmware. A custom GRUB menu file is added to repo.
#### Plymouth
[Plymouth](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/plymouth) is installed via AUR. I am using the solar theme.
#### SDDM
I am using breeze theme for SDDM.
